%Setting \cs{leftskip} to some positive value for a paragraph
%means that the \cs{hsize} stays the same, but every line
%starts with a glue item. Hanging indentation, on the other hand,
%is implemented by decreasing the \cs{hsize} value for the
%lines that hang, and shifting the finished 
%horizontal boxes horizontally in the surrounding vertical list.

%The difference between the two approaches becomes visible
%mainly in the fact that display formulas are not shifted
%when the \cs{leftskip} is altered.
%See Chapter~\ref{rules} for an example showing how leaders
%are affected by margin shifting.
